The rows and columns were obtained from the original dataset using the text to columns feauture.
The column Dt_Customer was formatted to Date with DD-MM-YYYY format.
Similarly, all the columns with numeric values were set to the number format and all the columns with characters were changed to the text format.
The case of all the headers was changed to lower case using =LOWER()
Deleted blank rows and cells with null entries. 
1 blank row, 24 null entries in income, and 1 null entry in dt_customer were found which were all then removed.
Remove duplicates feature was used to remove any existing duplicates. None were found.
The marital_status column had some strange entries like 'Alone','YOLO', and 'Absurd'. These were all updated to 'Single'.
While looking at the 2 YOLO entries, it was noticed that both the rows were completely same except for the id and the response. From the observation it looked like 2 entries for the same customer. One of them had 1 for response and the other had 0. I deleted the row with 0 response under the assumption that the customer accepted the offer in the last campaign (i.e response = 1). The person in charge had simply forgotten to delete the old record and had registered the customer again.
